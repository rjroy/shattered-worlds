# Implementation notes: card-effect handler registry

Orchestrated implementation of the card-effect handler registry refactor. Replaces
seven `switch (effect.kind)` statements across five files with one handler class per
`kind`, registered in an exhaustive map.

Branch: `effect-handler-registry` (off `master`).

## Setup findings

- **Token-IR collision is moot.** The researcher warned a `card-effect-token-ir`
  branch was unmerged and would collide on `compileEffect`/`describe.ts`. Verified
  against current master: `effectGlyphs.ts`/`compileEffect` and all other target
  files already exist on master (landed via #56/#57). No collision; proceed.
- **Real test command is `bun run test`** (`bun test --preload ./src/game/tests/testSetup.ts`),
  not bare `bun test`. Gate commands: `bun run typecheck`, `bun run test`,
  `bun run lint`, `bun run build`.
- All 6 `default:` sites confirmed at the plan's line numbers: available.ts (62, 127,
  202, 242), describe.ts (169), feedback.ts (95).
- No prior task files, no `.lore/lore-agents.md`. Roles filled by `general-purpose`
  (implementation/testing/review), with `typescript-quality` skill applied at Steps 2/5/7.

## Progress

<!-- Status: ☐ pending · ◐ in progress · ☑ done -->

- ☑ **Step 1** (Phase 0) — make silent switches fail closed (delete 6 `default:`, enumerate cases)
- ☑ **Step 2** (Phase 1) — scaffold EffectHandler base + EffectContext + EffectResult
- ☐ **Step 3** (Phase 1) — composite handlers (Modal/Sequence) + recursion seam
- ☐ **Step 4** (Phase 1) — DealProgress handlers + HazardTargetingHandler
- ☐ **Step 5** (Phase 1) — registry + dispatcher wiring (GO/NO-GO gate)
- ☐ **Step 6** (Phase 2) — migrate remaining leaf kinds, grouped by file
- ☐ **Step 7** (Phase 2) — remove transitional fallback; exhaustive map
- ☐ **Step 8** (Phase 3) — relocate connectorStyle into core; slim feedback.ts
- ☐ **Step 9** — validation against design + manual browser smoke

## Log

### Init (2026-06-13)
- Read plan + design + frontmatter schema. No existing tasks/notes/agents registry.
- lore-researcher: only plan+design exist for the registry itself; adjacent token-IR
  design is context not a prerequisite; ForceDestroy retro warns deferred effects
  (`pendingForceDestroy`, `skipDrawNext`) split logic into draw.ts/energy.ts — a
  per-kind handler may not capture deferred resolution. Carry as a watch item.
- Created branch `effect-handler-registry`.

### Step 1 — fail-closed (complete)
- Implementer removed `default:` from all 6 switches, enumerated explicit cases. No
  test edits, no behavior change. `CardEffect` union has 24 kinds.
- Reviewer (fresh context) audited every added case against the old default value
  1:1 — all correct. `computeLegalTargets` leaf step-0 body preserved as shared
  fallthrough (not collapsed to `[]`). Noted intentional asymmetry: `DealProgressAll`
  → non-null in `dealProgressOf` but `null` in `selectConnectorStyle` (matches master).
- Gate green both runs: typecheck clean, 613 pass / 0 fail, lint clean.
- Commit: per-step on feature branch (recoverability across the 9-step refactor).
- Commit `fa72ee4`.

### Step 2 — scaffold base + context (complete)
- New: `src/core/effects/{EffectContext.ts, EffectHandler.ts, handState.ts}`.
  EffectContext.ts holds canonical `EffectResult` (moved from energy.ts), `EffectContext`
  (pinned shape w/ `apply` recursion seam), `CompileContext {worldId:string; compactSequences:boolean}`,
  and `ConnectorStyle = 'progress'|'destroy'|'return'`.
- **ConnectorStyle defined in core, not type-imported from game.** eslint `no-restricted-imports`
  blocks even `import type` from `**/game/**` into core (no `allowTypeImports` on the base rule).
  So core defines it; `feedback.ts` imports+re-exports. Pre-stages Step 8.
- `compile` returns `EffectLine` (exported from `view/effectGlyphs.ts:52`).
- **Test count 613→616 explained:** `structural.test.ts` is data-driven — one boundary-check
  case per file under `src/core/`. The 3 new core files add 3 passing cases that themselves
  assert Phaser-freeness. Not a behavior change; no test files edited.
- Reviewer confirmed: helpers verbatim, no `any`/`as never`/casts, base defaults exact,
  HazardTargetingHandler stays abstract. Gate green: typecheck, 616 pass / 0 fail, lint.
- Commit pending below.
